The Simon Game is a game of memory skill. A random series of button presses is presented and the player is required to repeat the series. The series becomes longer and more complex as the game progress.  

The player can play in strict mode where the game restarts if a button press is wrong, then a new random series of button presses is presented. The player can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct.
